# music-memory-game

## Intro:
For my first project at General Assembly. I decided to build a memory game based music's most memorable song lyrics. The chance to take a trip down memory lane while testing their memory.

## Getting Started:

* The users clicks a card revealing the bottom card and tries to find the match while being timed.
* Once the user has found all 6 matches. The game is restarted and the User has the opportunity to beat their previous time.

## Planned Future Enhancements:

* Update Alert boxes to modals

* I plan to add sound effects that are triggered everytime the user plays a
  round based on whether or not they got a match.

* I plan to add scored showing previous finish times so the user can compare.

* I plan to update the play again button.
